# simple_weather_app

Yet another simple weather application.

Build instructions:

Install flutter,

clone the repo to your computer with

open `Api.key` file and insert your openweathermap.org API key, Google Maps Api key, save and close it

open terminal and run the followind commands

`git clone https://github.com/SL-Pirate/Simple-Weather-App.git`

`cd Simple-Weather-App`

`flutter build <target OS> --release`

Replace <target OS> with either linux, Android, IOS, Windows, Mac or web (as a web app)

NOTE: When building for IOS and MAC you might run into error because I have no way of testing for those platforms since I do not own such devices myself.
